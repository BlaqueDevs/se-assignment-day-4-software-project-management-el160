## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall Methodology
Overview:
Linear and Sequential: Waterfall is a traditional, linear approach where the project is divided into distinct phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Documentation-Driven: Detailed documentation is created at each stage, and requirements are typically defined upfront, with little to no changes allowed once the project begins.
Advantages:
Clear Structure: The linear progression through phases provides a clear structure and roadmap, making it easy to understand the project’s flow.
Well-Defined Requirements: Since all requirements are gathered and documented before development starts, there is less ambiguity in what needs to be delivered.
Easier to Manage: Project managers can easily track progress through the completion of phases, with specific milestones marking progress.
Suitable for Simple Projects: Works well for projects with clearly defined goals and stable requirements that are unlikely to change.
Disadvantages:
Inflexibility: Changes to requirements or design can be costly and time-consuming because they typically require going back to earlier phases.
Late Testing: Testing occurs only after the implementation phase, making it difficult to address issues or bugs that could have been identified earlier.
Client Feedback: Limited client involvement once the requirements are set, leading to potential misalignment with client expectations by the end of the project.
Risk of Project Failure: If an issue arises late in the project, it can jeopardize the entire project since there is little room for course correction.
Agile Methodology
Overview:
Iterative and Incremental: Agile is a flexible, iterative approach where the project is divided into small, manageable increments (sprints). Each sprint typically lasts 1-4 weeks and involves planning, development, testing, and review.
Adaptive Planning: Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams, with frequent client feedback and continuous improvement.
Advantages:
Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile is highly responsive to changes, allowing teams to adjust the project scope, requirements, and priorities based on ongoing feedback and new insights.
Continuous Delivery: Regularly delivering functional increments ensures that the project remains aligned with client needs and market demands.
Client Involvement: Clients are engaged throughout the project, providing feedback after each sprint, which ensures the final product meets their expectations.
Early Detection of Issues: Continuous testing and integration allow for early identification and resolution of issues, reducing the risk of major problems late in the project.
Disadvantages:
Less Predictability: Due to its adaptive nature, it can be challenging to predict the final cost, timeline, or scope at the start of the project.
Documentation May Suffer: Agile prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation, which may lead to incomplete or inadequate documentation.
Requires Discipline: Agile requires strong team discipline and collaboration, which can be challenging if the team is inexperienced or lacks proper communication.
Not Ideal for All Projects: Agile may not be suitable for projects with very strict regulations or where upfront, unchanging requirements are necessary.
Comparison:
Aspect	Waterfall	Agile
Approach	Linear, Sequential	Iterative, Incremental
Flexibility	Low	High
Client Involvement	Limited after requirements phase	Continuous throughout the project
Documentation	Extensive	Minimal, focused on working software
Risk Management	High risk if issues arise late	Lower risk due to continuous testing
Testing	Done after implementation	Integrated throughout the development
